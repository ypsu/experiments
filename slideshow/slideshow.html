<p>sometimes an animation can replace 1000 words, as the saying goes. the
problem is that i hate animations. they can be very distracting. it is hard for
me to read text if something else is jumping on the page. and even if you make
the animation stoppable, i still have problems with it. usually the animation
does not go with the speed i want it to go. it is either too fast or too slow.
and while the animation is progressing, i cannot afford to look away since it
might mean that i miss some key frame. sure, i could rewind, but i have yet to
see a control bar that has the right precision and responsiveness for me. and i
have not even talked about how cpu intensive most animations are. i think 90% of
the time animations can be replaced with some smart text or annotated
screenshots. and i think 90% of the remaining 10% can be replaced with very
lightweight slideshows. allow me to demonstrate. i have seen the following gif
on a friend's blog demonstrating how to subscribe to his blog:</p>

<img src="rss.gif" alt="animation">

<p>here's how i would replace it with a non-intrusive slideshow (requires
javascript):</p>

<p id="noscriptpara">[a slideshow will appear once javascript does its
magic.]</p>
<img id="framesimg" src="frames.png" alt="slideshow" hidden onload="main()">

<p>and this thing is not very high tech. you need very little javascript for
that, just look into the source of this page. i have generated the above
slideshow from <a href="frames.png">frames.png</a>. you configure the javascript
with the picture and the number of frames and it automatically shows only the
relevant frame. thanks to the annotations, i think it is easier to follow what
is happening. and frames.png is smaller than rss.gif (119 KB vs 212 KB). also
notice that this solution degrades gracefully. suppose the user does not have
javascript or a gif player (e.g. browsing on a kindle). they can still look at
at the individual frames of the slideshow and make sense of the content! overall
i think this a more user friendly alternative to animations.</p>

var curframe = 0, frames = 8, frameheight;
function main() {
  framesimg.width = framesimg.width;
  frameheight = framesimg.height / frames;
  framesimg.height = frameheight;
  framesimg.style.objectFit = 'none';
  framesimg.style.objectPosition = '0px 0px';
  framesimg.addEventListener('mousedown', framesclick);
  noscriptpara.hidden = true;
  framesimg.hidden = false;
}

function framesclick(event) {
  if (event.button != 0) return;
  if (event.shiftKey) {
    curframe += frames - 1;
  } else {
    curframe++;
  }
  curframe %= frames;
  framesimg.style.objectPosition = `0px -${curframe * frameheight}px`;
}
