# My experiments

Sometimes I do some random stuff out of curiosity or fun but then I never touch
that stuff again. But I have hard time deleting some of these things so I've
decided to just dump them here. You won't find much interesting things here,
mostly half-assed, non-functional pieces of bits. :)

I've actually used to put these on my "blog" but then deleted that because I
rarely updated it anyways.
