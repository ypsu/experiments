# topdown

I was bored and thought I make a rudimentary little topdown js shooter under an
hour or two. I've recorded a screencast of making this game which is available
at https://youtu.be/rSwe49Kw0gQ.

The game is at https://raw.githack.com/ypsu/experiments/master/topdown/topdown.html.

Use arrow keys or wasd to move around, use space to shoot.
