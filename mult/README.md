# Literate programming: FFT multiplication

[Literate programming][litprog] is an interesting way to make self-documenting
programs. I just had to try this. :)

My pet project for this was implementing multiplication of big numbers with FFT.
Actually for such a small project it worked perfectly - I don't recall that I've
had to debug a lot. Though I don't think I could use this approach on big
projects with changing requirements.

The result: [mult.pdf][result].
