This is a simple image viewer for HD screens. The application will
display all JPEG pictures in the current directory. This application
preloads 7 images forward and 2 backward. This allows fast image
switching so when you press the right key, the next image appears
immediately without waiting (unless you are pressing it too fast).

The application properly rotates the image file based on the JPEG's exif
information. Then the application resizes the image so that it fits to
the screen size.

The usage is simple:
	Right arrow - next image
	Left arrow - previous image
	Escape - exit


This application also comes with a selector application. This terminal
application shows the list of subdirectories in the current directory
from which you can select one via Up/Down and when you press the Enter
key it starts the image viewer in that subdirectory.

All of this software is for Linux.
