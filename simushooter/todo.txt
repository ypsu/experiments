Things which would be nice to do:

* Replace .desc files with generated .c and .h files. Then we need less files to
  load at startup.
* Implement doors: Then the game can paced better and we can make artifically
  larger on small map via key hunting. It also opens the way to interesting
  challenges: for example a timed door where you have to kill monsters very
  quickly to proceed otherwise the player has to restart.
* Add nice animations to the guns.
* Use larger fonts instead of the small ones we have currently.
* Use multiple small maps: this way we need less resources.
* Make the game configurable, especially it's keybinding. Reading this from a
  config is fine.
* Implement a menu for the game.
