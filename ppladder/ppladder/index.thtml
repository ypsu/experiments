<p>This is a ping pong ladder for the ping pong table {{.Address}}:</p>

<p>todo: insert picture</p>

<p><b>Ladder rules:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Register on the site to participate in the ladder.
    Anybody can join who can easily and regularly access the above ping ping table.</li>
  <li>Accept any challenge in a reasonable timeframe (within a few days)
    or record a loss to avoid gating progression for others.</li>
  <li>Challenge others and collect wins to climb up to the ladder.
    You have to organize challenge matches yourselves in private
    using the contact information on the profile pages.</li>
  <li>Only the most recent win/loss against an opponent counts.
    You must win against different people to increase your win count.</li>
  <li>A match is one ping pong match: whoever reaches 11 score first, wins.</li>
  <li>The loser must report the loss of the match.
    Go to the winner's profile to report the loss.</li>
  <li>Wait about a week before a rematch.</li>
  <li>The match must happen on the ping pong table {{.Address}}.</li>
  <li>The ladder only tracks matches from the past year
    so make sure to do an occasional rematch to maintain position.</li>
  <li>Honor system applies to the ladder
    but contact {{.Projectname}} at gmail.com for assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ping pong rules:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Aim: Hit the ball over the net onto your opponent's side. A point is won
    by you if your opponent is unable to return the ball to your side of the
    table (e.g. they miss the ball, they hit the ball but it misses your side of
    the table, or the ball hits the net), or if they hit the ball before it
    bounces on their side of the table.</li>
  <li>Scoring: The winner of a game is the first to 11 points. There must be a
    gap of at least two points between opponents at the end of the game though,
    so if the score is 10-10, the game goes in to extra play until one of the
    players has gained a lead of 2 points. The point goes to the player who
    successfully ends a rally, regardless of who has served.</li>
  <li>Serving: A player takes 2 serves before the ball switches to the
    opponent to serve, except during periods of extra play where it changes each
    time.</li>
  <li>Notes: The ball must first bounce on your side and then in your opponents.
    Your opponent must allow the ball to hit their side of the table before
    trying to return this.
    The ball must pass cleanly over the net - if it 'clips' the net and goes
    over, it is a 'let' and the serve is retaken. If it hits the net and doesnâ€™t
    go over, the point goes to the other player/team. There are no second
    serves.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Ping pong counters:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Score counting can be done in head, but there are online tools to make this easier.</li>
