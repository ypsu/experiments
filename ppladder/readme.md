# ppladder - ping pong ladder

this is a website that at some point i wanted to run.
we have a ping pong table in our apartment block's garden.
i was thinking of creating a ping pong leaderboard for this.
people would play matches and report losses on this site
and then site would then rank them into a ranklist for fun and profit.

could be run anywhere, all it needs is one append-only logfile as its database.
never got around running it
because i got the idea in autumn but finished it in winter.
by that time nobody was out playing anymore.

rules are explained in ppladder/index.thtml.
