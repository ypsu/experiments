# The kamehameha game

This is just a very small and silly 2 player game. A typical scene in Dragon
Ball Z is when two fighters shoot energy wave at each other. The energy waves
meet in the middle and a long tug of war starts between the fighters as they try
to overcome each other's energy wave. However energy waves are not realistic but
rockets are so in this little game you shoot little rockets towards the other
player rapidly, trying to overcome their rockets and finally hit them. Use left
and right shift to shoot the rockets.
