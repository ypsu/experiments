This is a very basic movie selector for HD screens. Select a movie via
the up-down keys, press enter and the video player is started.

It looks like this on the screen (if the window manager is properly set
up):

In order this to work first you need to start the display-poster
application. After this the selector app can be started. This app needs
to be started in the directory where your movies are at. You can try to
start it in the sample directory structure.

Each movie has a subdirectory. Let's say a movie's subdirectory is
called movie1. The the following files need to be found in it:

movie1/title.txt: the name in the list
       desc.txt: the description in the bottom
       poster.bmp: the picture on the right (720x1080 or smaller)
       movie.mkv/avi/mp4/flv: the movie to play
       opts.txt: override default options [optional]

If movie.mkv/avi/mp4/flv is missing, the program recurses into the
directory. This is handy for series. You can return to the parent via
Escape. If any other non-optional file is missing, the movie doesn't
appear in the list.

The selector is currently configured to hungarian. The locale overrides
must be disabled in selector.c in order to have the locale taken from
the environment. The locale is used for determining the alphabetical
order of the list items.
